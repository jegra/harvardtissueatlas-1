title: Deep Dye Drop
# summary of the tool
description: |
  The Dye Drop Assay is a versatile, low-cost, highly reproducible multiplexed microscopy
  method for obtaining detailed single-cell viability and cell cycle information from
  perturbation experiments. Dye Drop is composed of two main parts: i) an experimental
  method where cells in multi-well plates are perturbed in high throughput, stained, and
  fixed using sequential density displacement, then imaged, and ii) a set of associated
  computational tools that assign cell cycle state and calculate growth rate metrics. Dye
  Drop can be combined with CyCIF to yield further molecular and spatial information.
