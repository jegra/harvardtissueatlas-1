    CyCIF (cyclic immunofluorescence) is a robust and inexpensive method for highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging using standard instruments and reagents. The concept of repeatedly staining and imaging slides has been around for many years and most commonly involves antibody stripping using denaturants. [Gerdes et al (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3718135/) described an approach in which fluorophores are chemically inactivated after each of several rounds of immunofluorescence. [The t-CyCIF (Tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence) method](https://www.cycif.org/methods) by Lin et al (2018) builds on this and related approaches. 
    
    t-CyCIF uses formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor and tissue specimens mounted on glass slides. These are the most widely used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. t-CyCIF generates multiplexed images of FFPE samples using an iterative process (a cycle) in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high dimensional representation. Several variants are possible using direct and indirect immunofluorescence.
