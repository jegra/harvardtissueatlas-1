# summary of the tool
description: |
    Scimap is a scalable toolkit for analyzing spatial molecular data. The
    underlying framework is generalizable to spatial datasets mapped to XY
    coordinates. The package uses the anndata framework making it easy to
    integrate with other popular single-cell analysis toolkits. It includes
    preprocessing, phenotyping, visualization, clustering, spatial analysis and
    differential spatial testing. The Python-based implementation efficiently
    deals with large datasets of millions of cells.
