# name of the software
title: Multiple-choice microscopy pipeline (MCMICRO)
# summary of the tool
description: MCMICRO is the end-to-end processing pipeline for multiplexed whole tissue imaging and tissue microarrays. It comprises stitching and registration, segmentation, and single-cell feature extraction. Each step of the pipeline is containerized to enable portable deployment across an array of compute environments, including local machines, job-scheduling clusters and cloud environments like AWS. The pipeline execution is implemented in Nextflow, a workflow language that facilitates caching of partial results, dynamic restarts, extensive logging and resource usage reports.
