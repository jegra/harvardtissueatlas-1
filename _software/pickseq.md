# summary of the tool
description: |
    Pick-Seq is a form of micro-region sequencing in which small regions of tissue, containing 5-20 cells, are mechanically isolated on a microscope and then sequenced. Pick-Seq is compatible with several different fixed and frozen human specimens. It provides deep transcriptional profiling in the spatial contex and can be integrated with other spatial omics methods to achieve a hollistic view of the biology.
