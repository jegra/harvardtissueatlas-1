    description: Selective inhibition of the negative cell cycle regulator WEE1 may enhance the efficacy of DNA-damaging agents by reducing DNA damage repair. These are multiplexed cyclic immunofluorescence on paired pre- and post-WEE1 inhibitor tumor biopsies, from the first phase II study assessing the efficacy of the WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib with cisplatin in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Among patients with mTNBC treated with 0-1 prior lines, adavosertib combined with cisplatin narrowly missed the prespecified ORR cutoff of > 30%. The finding of immune infiltrated tumors in patients with clinical benefit to therapy requires validation in future studies.
