Bree Aldridge, PhD, is an Associate Professor of Molecular Biology and Microbiology and Biomedical Engineering at Tufts University whoâ€™s research focuses on designing optimized therapies for TB using cell biology and engineering approaches. The [Aldridge Lab] (https://sites.tufts.edu/aldridgelab/) is a multidisciplinary research team, integrating quantitative measurement with computational modeling and analysis to create intuitive descriptions of complex cell biology. The lab focuses on characterizing single-cell determinants of mycobacterial drug tolerance, understanding how growth heterogeneity is controlled, and engineering combination therapy.
