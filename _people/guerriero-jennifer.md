Jennifer Guerriero, PhD is a cancer biologist who leads the [Breast Immunology Laboratory](https://breasttumorimmunologylab.dana-farber.org/) in the Women’s Cancer Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Her research focuses on unraveling the complexity of tissue associated macrophages and their roles in cancer surveillance and progression  (TAMs). She and her group study the functions, regulation, and developmental identities of TAMs and perform basic science and translational experiments aimed at identifying clinically effective strategies for targeting TAMs, thereby promoting T-cell activation and weakening the immune-suppressive properties of the tumor microenvironment.
