The [OMS Atlas](https://www.ohsu.edu/spatial-systems-biomedicine-center/omic-and-multidimensional-spatial-oms-human-tumor-atlas) Center based at the Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) and led by [Joe Gray](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/people/joe-gray.cfm) is a component of the National Cancer Institute [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/implementation/human-tumor-atlas) (HTAN), a multi-center program within the National Cancer Institute that emerged from the [Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative). All data associated with HTAN can be found at the [Human Tumor Atlas](https://humantumoratlas.org/). Our team us a collaborator on the OMS Atlas focusing on the application of multi-dimensional CyCIF imaging methods to clinical trial samples.

The OMS is focused on elucidating mechanisms of therapy resistance in three clinical scenarios in which disease recurrence is a major concern: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent (c) castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. Diverse imaging and omic methods are being applied to this analysis including several complementary ways to create spatial maps of cell types and states. These include multiplex immuno-histochemistry, CyCIF, Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM).
