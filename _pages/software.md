    Analyzing spatially resolved data requires the development of new software. The LSP is actively engaged in a wide variety of open source software projects aimed at the analysis of highly multiplexed whole slide images. These include methods for stitching images together into seamless gigapixel mosaics, machine learning tools for interpreting imaging features, visualization tools, and rapid and intuitive interaction with image data.

    The two largest software projects in the group are MCMICRO, an end-to-end pipeline for transforming images into quantitative cell x feature data and Minerva, a suite of tools for visualization of large and complex images in a browser.
