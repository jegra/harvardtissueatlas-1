    {% include vimeo-card.html id="724884741" title="AACR Virtual Journal Club: Cancer Discovery With Dr. Peter Sorger" description=" This AACR Journal Club discusses features Peter Sorger, PhD, discussing his article “The Spatial Landscape of Progression and Immunoediting in Primary Melanoma at Single-Cell Resolution.” The intricacies of primary melanoma progression are revealed by a combination of high-plex imaging, 3D high-resolution microscopy, and spatially resolved microregion transcriptomics. Dr. Sorger shows that this unprecedented spatiotemoporal resolution uncovers recurrent cellular neighborhoods and the landscape of immune evasion and immunoediting." %}
